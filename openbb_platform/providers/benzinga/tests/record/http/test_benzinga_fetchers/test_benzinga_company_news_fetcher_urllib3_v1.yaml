        does not heat up, NVDA is on track to achieve $45 - $50 in earnings in 2027.&nbsp;If
        this comes true, on this basis, NVDA is the cheapest tech stock.&nbsp;Of course
        the reality is that competition will heat up.&nbsp; Nonetheless, investors
        need to be aware that based on the current trajectory, NVDA is not an expensive
        stock. </strong></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Nvidia earnings are overshadowing everything
        else.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing
        is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various
        crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>FOMC
        Minutes</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The FOMC minutes were hawkish and do not
        support momo gurus&#39; narrative of near term rate cuts.&nbsp;Expect momo
        gurus to come up with a new narrative to run up the stock market.&nbsp;Keep
        in mind that momo gurus&rsquo; real job is to persuade their followers to
        buy stocks under the disguise of analysis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Jobless
        Claims</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Initial claims is a leading indicator and
        carries heavy weight in the adaptive <a href=\\\"https://thearorareport.com/ALLOCATION%2BMODELS.htm\\\">ZYX
        Asset Allocation Model</a> with inputs in <a href=\\\"https://thearorareport.com/unique-zyx-asset-allocation-4/\\\">ten
        categories</a>.&nbsp;In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes
        itself with market conditions.&nbsp; Most models on Wall Street are static.&nbsp;
        They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Initial
        claims came at 201K vs. 216K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture
        is very strong, especially at the low end.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Japan</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Japan&rsquo;s
        Nikkei 225 crossed its high from 1989 for the first time in 34 years.&nbsp;There
        is an important lesson for investors here.&nbsp;Investors have come to believe
        that bear markets are short, but that is looking backwards through recent
        U.S. history.&nbsp;Looking forward, given rising national debt and reckless
        government spending, there is a fair probability of a long bear market in
        the U.S. Therefore, it is imperative that investors increase their knowledge
        and access to a resource such as The Arora Report that has a long track record
        of making money in both bull and bear markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Magnificent

        may see some selling as investors sell bitcoin to buy NVDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Protection
        Band And What To Do Now</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is important for investors
        to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consider continuing
        to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk
        preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills
        or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short
        term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the
        upside at the same time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can determine your protection
        bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate
        for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is
        appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge,
        the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less
        than cash plus hedges.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that
        you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding
        enough cash.&nbsp; </strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting
        partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider
        stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;
        High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Traditional
        60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Probability based risk reward
        adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation
        at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60%
        allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality
        bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring
        sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical
        positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The
        Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.&nbsp; The Arora Report correctly
        called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009,
        the COVID crash, the post-COVID bull market, and the 2022 bear market.&nbsp;

        a handheld input device that comprises a stylus and a removable sleeve.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        input-output capabilities of the device could be shared between the stylus
        and the removable sleeve, which could include haptic output devices and a
        battery. The sleeve could also be attached to an item without electronics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>See

        further explains that the sleeve could include conductors for translating
        touch input on the sleeve to the touch sensor circuitry on the stylus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It
        could also have a deformable member for translating forces on the sleeve to

        by an external camera and used with motion sensor data from the stylus to
        track the handheld input device.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the patent largely
        discusses the future of the Apple Pencil, it also hints at the potential for
        using this technology with everyday items.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For instance,
        a sensor-filled sleeve could be wrapped around a utensil, allowing its movements
        to be tracked with a mixed-reality headset such as Apple Vision Pro.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why

        Tech, Big Moves</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let&#8217;s put some context behind these
        moves, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1760503556635840587\\\">courtesy</a>
        of the <strong>Kobeissi Letter</strong> on <strong>X</strong> on Thursday.<br>\u2022
        S&amp;P 500 futures staged a 1.5% reversal after the market&#8217;s reaction
        to Nvidia earnings.<br>\u2022 Since 3pm ET on Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 added
        $600 billion of value.<br>\u2022 Nvidia itself was responsible for around
        $220 billion of that value being added.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;In other
        words, more than one-third of the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s value added since 3pm
        came from Nvidia,&#8221; the analyst said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>He added: &#8220;Nvidia
        is now just 20% smaller than the entire combined value of Germany&#8217;s
        stock market. Tech giant is an understatement.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some
        of the other post- and pre-market moves added to the weight. Having fallen
        0.6% on Wednesday, shares in $3 trillion market cap <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong>
        (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)
        are up 1.7% on Thursday, while $2.8 trillion market cap <strong>Apple Inc</strong>
        (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>)
        gained 0.4% on Wednesday and 0.6% on Thursday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Big
        Tech, Big Influence</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the above, what investors have
        to ask next is, can this market continue to rally without the tech stocks?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Such
        are their weightings and influence on the overall market \u2014 if they go
        down, the S&amp;P 500 goes down, and investors lose confidence. This is where
        market correction possibilities lie.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If investors lose confidence
        in the market, they can quite easily become sellers of everything, and the
        influence is spread wider than just the U.S. markets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;The
        post-close rally in U.S. tech stocks after <span class=\\\"il\\\">Nvidia</span>&#8216;s
        earnings has fueled risk-on activity today. Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 index
        closed at record highs on Thursday with a 2.2% rally,&#8221; said Marc Chandler
        at Bannockburn Global Forex.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, what could it take? A set
        of weak report from one of the Mega-techs? Perhaps Nvidia itself? Don&#8217;t
        count on it. The company has beaten the market in 12 out the last 13 quarters,
        according to Zacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, investors still love the
        stock. Only last week it was reported that hedge fund Tudor Investment increased
        its stake in Nvidia from 14,000 to 132,000 shares \u2014 giving it a total
        holding worth $100.6 million.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Now Read: <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/02/37241485/broadcom-the-magnificent-7-stock-in-waiting-can-the-chipmaker-replace-ev-carmaker-tesla\\\">Broadcom,

        Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\\\">NVDA</a>)
        delivered its fourth quarter results and they smashed Wall Street&rsquo;s
        expectations across the board as generative AI demand is surging across the
        globe. While the Data Center business is running the show, Nvidia&rsquo;s
        gaming business also has an important role in its success. Over the last 12
        months, Nvidia&rsquo;s stock price easily surpassed those of its rivals, Advanced
        Micro Devices (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMD#NASDAQ\\\">AMD</a>)
        and Intel (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\\\">INTC</a>).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Fourth
        Quarter Highlights</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the quarter ended on January 29th,
        Nvidia reported total revenue grew&nbsp;265%&nbsp;to&nbsp;$22.10 billion,
        topping LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of $20.62 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Center business,
        which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue
        skyrocket 217%&nbsp;to $18.4 billion, also beating analysts&#39; expectations
        of $17.2 billion. However, data center revenue was harmed by recent U.S. restrictions
        on exporting advanced AI chips to China.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The gaming segment
        brought in 2.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of $2.7 billion as it rose&nbsp;56%&nbsp;YoY.
        Impressively, net income rose&nbsp;769%&nbsp;YoY&nbsp;to&nbsp;$12.29 billion&nbsp;with
        adjusted earnings of $5.16 also topping LSEG&#39;s estimate of&nbsp;$4.64.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Competitive
        Threat Is Rising</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nvidia is undoubtedly at the top of its
        game, but its rivals are not standing still. Its main rival, AMD, is investing
        heavily in its own AI chips. Moreover, AMD is claiming its new MI300X&nbsp;surpasses
        Nvidia&rsquo;s H100 in certain workloads. AMD rolled out the MI300X before
        2023 came to an end, placing it as the industry&rsquo;s most advanced AI accelerator.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Intel
        also has its own server chips while it continues to work on expanding its
        own capabilities on the AI front.Interestingly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:<a
        class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)
        turned to Intel and not Nvidia to make its future in-house chips. Microsoft
        plans to use 18A manufacturing technology that Intel developed. With this
        move, Microsoft will undoubtedly boost Intel and its made-to-order chip business.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Perhaps
        an even bigger threat to Nvidia doesn&rsquo;t come from its direct rivals
        but from its customers like Microsoft that are racing to develop their own
        specialized AI chips to lower their reliance on Nvidia&rsquo;s offerings.
        Moreover, such customers brought in more than half of its Data Center revenue
        during the latest reported quarter, as Nvidia attributed more than half of
        quarterly revenue to large cloud providers for conducting internal workloads
        and external customers.&nbsp;Besides Microsoft, those that are either already
        offering or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips are Amazon.com
        Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\\\">AMZN</a>),
        Alphabet (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ\\\">GOOG</a>)-owned
        Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\\\">META</a>)
        and even the EV leader, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\\\">TSLA</a>).&nbsp;However,&nbsp;Reuters
        reported that Nvidia has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI
        in an effort to get them on board to&nbsp;make&nbsp;custom chips for them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>During
        the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of&nbsp;$24 billion while CEO
        Jensen Huang&nbsp;assured investors that the AI chip leader is all set for
        continued growth.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER: This content is

        today&#39;s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL,
        MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Our proprietary formula,
        exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation
        takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated
        every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the
        market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and
        be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay
        alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market&#39;s pulse to
        optimize your trading gains. Now, let&#39;s dive into the stock analysis:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>SPDR
        S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE\\\">SPY</a>)</strong>
        The SPY is currently being traded around the level of 502.85. For those optimistic
        about the market, the initial goal is to surpass the 503.95 mark. A sustained
        move above this level could attract more buyers, aiming to reach 505.32. Holding
        above 505.32 during the trading day could lead to a further climb towards
        506.06. The ambitious target for bullish traders today is set at 506.71 for
        the SPY.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the flip side, if the SPY fails to maintain
        the 502.85 level as support, a downward movement is anticipated. The first
        checkpoint for the bears is 501.74, followed by a potential dip to 500.91
        if selling intensifies. A significant breach below this level could see the
        SPY reaching a more substantial support at 500.17. In the event of an extensive
        sell-off, the bearish goal for the day is pegged at 498.93.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Invesco
        QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ\\\">QQQ</a>)</strong>
        The Q&#39;s are trading around a pivotal point at 433.64. Bulls in the market
        are eyeing a move above 434.76, hoping to establish it as a firm support level.
        If they succeed, the next target would be 435.88, with the potential to extend
        gains to 436.58. A robust trading session could propel the Q&#39;s to test
        the 437.47 level, with the ultimate bullish aim for today being 438.89.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Should
        the Q&#39;s struggle to stay above 433.64, bears might take the reins, pushing
        the price down to 432.84. A continuation of this bearish momentum could lead
        to tests of 431.82 and 431.18. If these supports falter, the bearish objective
        for the day is set at a lower target of 430.16.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Apple
        Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>)</strong>
        Apple&#39;s stock is hovering around the 182.96 mark. Bullish traders are
        looking for this level to act as a solid foundation, setting the stage for
        a push towards 183.38. If the momentum remains positive, we could see a move
        towards 184.09. The highest target for Apple&#39;s bulls today is aiming for
        a peak at 184.59.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Conversely, if Apple fails to hold 182.96
        as a support level, the price might be pushed down to 182.27. Further selling
        pressure could lead to a descent towards 181.25, and if the selling doesn&#39;t
        abate, 180.60 could be the next stop. The bearish scenario envisions a potential
        drop to the day&#39;s low target at 180.10.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Microsoft
        Corp. (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>)</strong>
        Microsoft is currently trading near 408.46. Bulls are hopeful that the stock
        will sustain above this level, aiming for a rally to 409.69, which they hope
        to establish as a key support. If this level is maintained, the next bullish
        target is 410.64, with an ultimate high for the day at 411.72.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If
        Microsoft cannot maintain 408.46 as a support level, bears might look to push
        the price down to 407.11. A break below this could lead to further declines
        towards 406.01. Persistent bearish pressure could see the stock moving down
        to 404.92, with the lowest bear target set at 402.74.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>NVIDIA
        Corporation (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\\\">NVDA</a>)</strong>
        NVIDIA is currently trading around 765.63. Bulls are aiming for an upward
        push to 768.67, seeking to establish it as a solid support level. The next
        bullish milestone is 771.72, with a potential rally extending to 775.50. The
        most optimistic target for NVIDIA&#39;s bulls today is 778.91.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If
        NVIDIA fails to keep 765.63 as a reliable support, bears might look to drive
        the price down to 761.29. A breakdown below this level could lead to a further
        decline to 755.75. If bearish momentum continues, a test at 752.32 could be
        on the horizon, with the ultimate bearish target for the day being 749.56.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Alphabet
        Inc Class A (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\\\">GOOGL</a>)</strong>
        Alphabet is trading around the 144.72 level. Bulls are looking to hold this
        as a support base, aiming for an upward move to 145.94. With sustained bullish
        pressure, the price could climb to the day&#39;s high target of 146.89.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Should
        Alphabet&#39;s stock fail to maintain 144.72 as a support, bears might push
        it down to 143.77. A further decline could lead to a test of 143.17, with
        heavy selling potentially dragging the price down to the day&#39;s lowest
        target of 142.53.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:<a
        class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\\\">META</a>)</strong>
        Meta is being traded around 479.47. The bulls are hopeful for the stock to
        remain strong above this level, with an initial target set at 480.96. A successful
        bullish push could lead to further gains, with a high target for the day set
        at 485.96.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If Meta cannot sustain 479.47 as a support level,
        a downward trend might be initiated, with the first lower target at 477.50.
        Continued bearish pressure could drive the price down to 475.19, with the
        lowest bear target for the day being 473.93.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Tesla
        Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\\\">TSLA</a>)</strong>
        Tesla&#39;s current trading point is at 195.91. Bulls are looking to drive
        the price upwards to 197.50, with further gains potentially leading to 200.43.
        In a strong market rally, Tesla might test even higher levels, with an optimistic
        target for the day set at 206.71.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If Tesla cannot hold 195.91
        as a firm support, bears may target a lower level at 193.81, with continued
        selling potentially bringing the price down to 191.52. In a scenario of intensified
        selling, the bearish aim for the day would be set at 189.22.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Final
        Word: Today&#39;s trading session is poised to revolve around the release
        of employment data at 8:30AM ET, followed by PMI data at 9:45AM ET. Additional
        market volatility is expected around 1PM due to the Treasury&#39;s 30 Year
        TIPS Auction. Market participants will also be closely analyzing NVIDIA&#39;s
        earnings, which exceeded expectations, potentially influencing market dynamics.

        day. Good luck!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Morning Memo is curated by RIPS, a pro

        iPhone 13 ranked fourth on the list, despite being released in September 2021.
        The pone was popular in India and Japan according to the report. India passed
        the 10 million smartphone milestone for the first time in 2023, one of five
        countries to hit the mark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 made
        up six spots on the list with the Pro and Pro Max more expensive models ranking
        well, which could highlight the average sale price potential Apple has as
        users look for premium smartphone models with more capabilities and functions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Released
        in September 2023, the iPhone 15 having several models on the list with only
        around three months of time on the market shows the strength of the newest
        model. The iPhone 15 Pro Max was the top selling smartphone globally in the
        fourth quarter according to the report.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The list illustrates
        that Apple can continue to release a new model annually with demand from users
        and older models will also continue to sell well with lower prices. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Together,
        the top 10 smartphones sold in 2023 made up 20% market share globally, which
        set a new record. Apple and Samsung dominated the list and have been the only
        two companies on the annual list from Counterpoint since 2021.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>AAPL

        the following:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>This article is about the big
        picture, not an individual stock.&nbsp;The chart of NVDA stock is being used
        to illustrate the point.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Nvidia is at the center of the artificial
        intelligence revolution.&nbsp;It is the best performing stock in the S&amp;P
        500 this year.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The chart shows a pullback yesterday.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The
        chart shows the volume yesterday was high when the stock dropped.&nbsp;This
        is a negative.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>RSI on the chart shows that NVDA is no longer
        overbought after the pullback.&nbsp;RSI shows that the stock can go either
        way after earnings.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>The chart shows extreme positive
        positioning in NVDA prior to the drop. The best way to understand extreme
        positive positioning is to think of a boat where everyone is on the same side.&nbsp;
        It does not cause any problems as long as the waters are calm.&nbsp;However,
        if a storm comes and everyone is on the same side, the boat sinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>The
        chart shows that yesterday, extreme positive positioning took a hit, resulting
        in a large drop in the stock.&nbsp;The positioning took a hit, not because
        a storm came, but because investors started jumping off the boat in anticipation
        of a storm from the earnings that are ahead.</strong></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The
        options market is predicting an 11% move in NVDA stock in either direction
        after earnings.&nbsp;Pause for a second and think about it &ndash; this is
        the gain or loss of $200B in market value.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>We previously
        shared with you:</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Less informed
        investors do not understand that stocks do not move based on published consensus

        minutes will be released at 2pm ET.&nbsp;Normally, FOMC minutes are market
        moving. However, today market movements are likely to be governed by position
        squaring by institutional investors ahead of NVDA earnings.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>In

        Band And What To Do Now</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is important for investors
        to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consider continuing
        to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk
        preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills
        or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short
        term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the
        upside at the same time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can determine your protection
        bands by adding cash to hedges.&nbsp; The high band of the protection is appropriate
        for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is
        appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp; If you do not hedge,
        the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less
        than cash plus hedges.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that
        you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding
        enough cash.&nbsp;</strong>When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting
        partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider
        stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;
        High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Traditional
        60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Probability based risk reward
        adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation
        at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60%
        allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality
        bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring
        sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical
        positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The
        Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.&nbsp;The Arora Report correctly

        rose further, with 70% of their long positions allocated to their top 10 holdings.
        According to analysts, this rising concentration is partly driven by confidence
        in specific industries, such as artificial intelligence and healthcare. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The
        latter experienced notable enthusiasm for innovations such as GLP-1 therapies.

        reveals a record tilt towards the momentum factor within hedge fund long portfolios,
        marking the most substantial growth orientation since 2016.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;While
        trimming exposure to mega-cap tech, hedge funds looked for new alpha in cyclicals
        and other pockets of growth. Alongside strong U.S. economic data and hints
        of improvement in the global manufacturing cycle, funds lifted their tilt
        to cyclical industries versus defensives to the highest since 2016,&#8221;

        back more than 100% since the beginning of 2023. Now it&#8217;s on deck to
        join DJIA \u2014 the so-called &#8220;venerable index.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As
        one of Wall Street&#8217;s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn&#8217;t
        get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it
        replaced  <strong>General Electric</strong>, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure.

        of this elite club still matter?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/02/37230758/amazon-replacing-walgreens-in-dow-jones-industrial-might-not-be-a-great-thing-will-\\\">Amazon
        Replacing Walgreens In Dow Jones Industrial Might Not Be A Great Thing &#8211;
        &#8216;Will History Repeat Itself?&#8217;</a></em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To be
        selected, companies have to meet certain criteria in terms of financial health
        and stability, liquidity, industry leadership and relevance to the economy,
        among others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s fair to say, then, that even though
        companies are not included purely on market cap \u2014 as are indexes such
        as the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 there must be a nod toward size and scale of operations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another
        is its visibility. The Dow is usually listed first among the U.S. stock indexes
        in financial media, and it is followed by a broad range of investors and included
        in index-tracking funds such as the <strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average
        ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/DIA#NYSE\\\">DIA</a>).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If
        the index components are not selected on market cap, why Amazon? See the chart
        below.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-full\\\"><img

        class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">Consumer Retail Or Big Tech?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;Reflecting
        the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer
        retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,&#8221; the S&amp;P
        Dow Jones Indices said in the announcement. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The move was
        prompted by retailer <strong>Walmart</strong>&#8216;s (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WMT#NYSE\\\">WMT</a>) decision to
        conduct a 3:1 stock split. This reduced the retailer&#8217;s share price and
        weighting on the index, but Walmart remains a member.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But
        Amazon&#8217;s entry brings new opportunity \u2014 or risk \u2014 depending
        on how stocks perform in the coming months.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It now joins
        <strong>Apple Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>)
        and <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\\\">MSFT</a>) \u2014 fellow
        members of the prestigious Magnificent 7 technology giants \u2014 along with
        other tech heavyweights <strong>IBM </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IBM#NYSE\\\">IBM</a>), <strong>Cisco
        Systems Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CSCO#NASDAQ\\\">CSCO</a>)
        and <strong>Intel Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\\\">INTC</a>).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just
        look what the <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/23/12/36325391/magnificent-7-widens-gap-with-rest-of-s-p-500-but-that-may-change-in-2024\\\">Magnificent
        7 did for the S&amp;P 500 last year</a>. The Mag7 stocks were responsible
        for more than half of the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 24% gain over 2023. Taken together,
        they climbed 75% while the other 493 stocks managed just a 12% rally.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Plus,
        the Dow doesn&#8217;t hold <strong>Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ\\\">TSLA</a>) which has
        fallen 22% in 2024, subtracting from the Mag7&#8217;s gains this year. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        arguable, then, whether Amazon should be a member of the Dow Industrials or
        better for the Dow Industrials to have Amazon, alongside its tech-heavyweight
        peers, as a member.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"wp-block-heading\\\">History
        Repeating Itself?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On more point to make following comments
        on CNBC&#8217;s last call on Tuesday night by host Brian Sullivan, who suggested
        the performances by Apple and Microsoft were not that impressive when they
        first joined the DJIA.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For Apple, the first two years after
        joining DJIA was \\\"dead money\\\" while Microsoft saw a flat stock for almost
        15 years on the index. He added: &#8220;Will history repeat itself?&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s
        impossible to predict, but two points need to be made here. First both Apple
        and Microsoft, as per the selection criteria, gained their places exactly
        because their share prices were stable and they were leaders in their industry.
        Second, share price performance is a factor of earnings growth, not the membership
        of a particular club \u2014 however influential it may be.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Price
        Action</strong>: Walgreens&#8217; stock fell 64% since it was included in
        the DJIA. At market close on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement, shares in
        the healthcare retailer closed up 1.5%. It&#8217;s currently trading at $21.44
        \u2014 down 3.9%. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the last check, Amazon was trading
        at $169.69 per share \u2014 up 1.56%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Now Read: <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/23/12/36325391/magnificent-7-widens-gap-with-rest-of-s-p-500-but-that-may-change-in-2024\\\">&#8216;Magnificent

        complied with the EU's demands to allow sideloading of apps via third-party
