        who accused it for&nbsp;abusing&nbsp;its&nbsp;market dominance in&nbsp;the
        distribution of music streaming apps,&nbsp;and is appealing the court&rsquo;s
        decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple&rsquo;s
        lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering
        rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent
        self-preferencing&nbsp;the Google search engine over others as well as its
        steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented
        measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory
        manner.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>EU watch dogs are also going after Meta for
        its&nbsp;pay or consent&rdquo; model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned
        about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation
        of personal data by gatekeepers&nbsp;and will question if Meta is&nbsp;obtaining&nbsp;consent
        from users when&nbsp;intending&nbsp;to combine or cross-use their personal
        data across different core platform services.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since enforcing
        the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that&nbsp;Alphabet,
        Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft&nbsp;fully comply with the rules.
        Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable
        for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital
        economy and regulating gatekeepers. With Apple, the EC clearly showed it means
        business.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER:&nbsp;This content is for informational

        Manufacturing International Co</strong> TSMC held a 62% market share in the
        first quarter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At a forum called &#8220;Taiwan in the era
        of techno-geopolitics&#8221; in Taipei hosted by the new think tank Research
        Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology (DSET), veteran
        analyst Ray Yang said he believes Taiwan&#8217;s semiconductor industry will
        maintain its competitive edge for another eight to 10 years, Focus Taiwan
        <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202406250026\\\"

        director at the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center,
        stated, &#8220;Next year, the industry will utilize 2-nanometer process technology,
        and I believe Taiwan will continue to dominate until at least the 9-angstrom
        generation.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>During these partnerships, Yang emphasized
        the importance of international collaboration and the need to protect Taiwan&#8217;s
        research security.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, Taiwan&#8217;s Semiconductor
        Industry is facing geopolitical pressure linked to the U.S. concerns that
        most of the IC manufacturing is happening in Asia. However, it should still
        reach a mutually beneficial compromise with Washington, Taipei Times <a target=\\\"_blank\\\"

        Young, a former TSMC R&amp;D director, told at the DSET forum that the semiconductor
        industry faces risks from US-China trade tensions-driven &#8220;geopolitics
        2.0.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to Young, &#8220;geopolitics 2.0&#8221;
        is a contemporary version of what he called &#8220;geopolitics 1.0,&#8221;
        which took place in the 1980s when the U.S., feeling threatened by Japan,
        sought to dismantle its dominance in the semiconductor industry. He noted
        that the current risk stems from the U.S.&#8217;s concerns amid its trade
        frictions with China, particularly the potential loss of Taiwan&#8217;s competitive
        edge if Taiwanese companies are asked to set up factories in the U.S.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However,
        Young pointed out that American companies, including top IC firms such as
        <strong>Qualcomm Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QCOM#NASDAQ\\\">QCOM</a>)
        and <strong>Nvidia Corp</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\\\">NVDA</a>),
        still rely heavily on TSMC for their chip manufacturing needs. This reliance
        makes it unlikely that the U.S. government would take actions resulting in
        mutually assured destruction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Young also called for cooperation
        with non-US countries such as Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, and even the
        Middle East, which have invested in the industry.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TSMC stock
        gained over 72% in the last 12 months, buoyed by the artificial intelligence
        frenzy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Price Action: </strong>At the last check
        on Wednesday, TSM shares traded higher by 0.21% to $172.96 premarket.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong><em>

        with iOS 18&nbsp;the <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/11/35843343/thanks-to-eu-after-usb-c-iphones-will-support-rcs-in-2024-heres-what-it-means-for-green-bubbles\\\">company
        now officially supports RCS</a>, but the feature was not available to beta
        users until now. With RCS, <strong>iPhone</strong> users can&nbsp;send rich
        messages, including&nbsp;audio and larger media files, to <strong>Android</strong>
        users. The Messages app will label these as &#8220;Text Message \u2013 RCS&#8221;.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The\_first
        beta of iOS 18, released earlier this month, showed no signs of RCS. However,
        the second beta, released on Monday,\_added a new RCS toggle\_in the <strong>Settings</strong>
        app for some users, causing confusion among beta testers, <a href=\\\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/24/ios-18-rcs-iphone-beta/\\\">reported</a>
        9to5Mac.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other users on social also reported that RCS is
        starting to work for them on iOS 18 Beta 2, complete with typing indicators,
        read receipts, and reactions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed

        It Matters: </strong>RCS support on the iPhone\_depends on\_Apple\_collaborating
        with carrier partners\_to update their bundles shipped\_with iOS.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Currently,
        only a few carriers such as <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> and <strong>T-Mobile</strong>
        in the U.S.\_have updated their carrier bundles\_to support RCS on the\_iPhone,
        the report noted.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While more carriers may enable&nbsp;RCS
        support on the iPhone&nbsp;by September, when iOS 18&nbsp;will be publicly
        available, most beta users likely won&#8217;t&nbsp;be able to test the&nbsp;new
        feature. A public beta&nbsp;of&nbsp;iOS 18 will be available&nbsp;next month.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Check

        it was reported that Jobs significantly <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/24/03/37921097/steve-jobs-didnt-become-a-billionaire-because-of-apple-it-was-actually-pixar-and-the-toy-story-movie\\\">shaped
        his career and wealth</a> at<strong>&nbsp;Pixar Animation Studios</strong>
        after being ousted from Apple in 1985. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>His return to Apple
        in the late 90s marked a significant turnaround for the company. <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/38985210/steve-jobs-turned-around-apples-fortunes-27-years-ago-not-by-making-mac-better-than-windows-but-by-u\\\">Jobs&#8217;
        marketing acumen played a crucial role</a> in this turnaround, focusing on
        the values of what he wanted Apple to be known for rather than pushing product
        details to prospective buyers. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Items related to Jobs often
        fetch high prices at auction. For instance, a $4.01 check he wrote to <strong>RadioShack</strong>
        sold for over $46,000 in December. In March earlier this year, a <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/03/37900047/steve-jobs-autographed-business-card-breaks-record-at-auction-how-sale-price-compares-to-el\\\">signed
        business card by Jobs from 1983</a> set a new record as the most expensive
        business card ever sold, fetching $181,183, far surpassing the pre-auction
        estimate of $10,000.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If true to its estimate, the suits
        get auctioned at between $10,000 to $30,000, they might end up getting listed
        among the top 10 most expensive suits in the world, which includes the likes
        of <strong>Dormeuil Vanquish II</strong> ( $1 million),<strong> Kiton K50</strong>

        these concerns, Ives&#8217; comments on the future potential of Nvidia and

        the views of other experts, such as economist <strong>Jeffrey Roach</strong>,
