        to convert waste, carbon, and renewable power into sustainable aviation fuel
        (SAF) and immediately accelerate decarbonization of the aviation industry
        globally. CirculAir is a breakthrough offering that provides an economical
        and commercialized alternative to Fischer-Tropsch technology to create eFuels,
        Power-to-Liquids (PtL), and Waste-to-Fuels leveraging the already ASTM-approved
        SAF production pathway that uses ethanol as the biointermediate and Alcohol-to-Jet
        (ATJ) technology to produce SAF and Renewable Diesel (RD).<br />\\n&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<p>CirculAir
        is a formalized joint offering and end-to-end technology solution that turns
        nearly any waste source including municipal solid waste (MSW), agricultural
        residues, carbon emissions from industrial and refining processes, carbon
        dioxide (CO2) through direct air capture, and renewable power into SAF. CirculAir
        combines the groundbreaking technologies of LanzaTech and LanzaJet to form
        an efficient and economically compelling offering that provides the aviation
        industry with a solution to produce waste-based SAF on a global scale. CirculAir
        will combine LanzaTech and LanzaJet&#39;s technologies; first incorporating
        LanzaTech&#39;s novel gas fermentation technology to convert nearly any waste
        resource into CarbonSmart&trade; ethanol and then second, executing LanzaJet&#39;s
        Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology by taking the ethanol and converting it to
        drop-in SAF. The SAF made through this process is expected to reduce aviation
        emissions by at least&nbsp;85%&nbsp;and can also produce carbon negative results,
        depending on the feedstock.</p>\\n\\n<p>SAF is estimated to account for 65&ndash;70%&nbsp;of
        overall aviation emissions reduction to achieve net zero by 2050, making it
        a critical tool for this hard-to-abate industry; however, historic supply
        constraints, high costs, and technical barriers have made it difficult for
        the industry to default to SAF as the primary fuel source. CirculAir breaks
        down these barriers. The technology is able to turn a wide range of waste-based
        feedstocks into SAF, and it is being adopted by a range of customers across
        the globe. This widespread adoption is projected to accelerate the production
        and economies of scale necessary to bring down the global cost of SAF.</p>\",\"url\":\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/06/39519678/lanzatech-and-lanzajet-introduce-circulair-for-sustainable-aviation-fuel\",\"image\":[],\"channels\":[{\"name\":\"News\"}],\"stocks\":[{\"name\":\"LNZA\"}],\"tags\":[]},{\"id\":39519665,\"author\":\"Benzinga

        the number of promising therapies for celiac disease (CeD) grows, so does
        the need to improve the measurement of clinically relevant histological endpoints.
        The new approach presented in a peer-reviewed publication, led by Jack Syage,
        Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Entero Therapeutics, recognized
        the need to advance beyond qualitative measures of histologic small intestinal
        health and to develop a more accurate and sensitive scale based on the independent
        quantitative measures of architectural changes (villus height to crypt depth
        ratio, Vh:Cd) and inflammation (intraepithelial lymphocyte count, IEL) already
        in use. The team created a composite score (VCIEL) for these two measures
        that helps overcome the individual variances to improve the overall accuracy
        of histological evaluation. The publication demonstrated the significant benefits
        of the VCIEL scale based on the results of four previous clinical trials.
        The significance of this achievement was highlighted in a special editorial
        feature by the journal, demonstrating the importance of this novel metric

        SA</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SUZ#NYSE\\\">SUZ</a>)
        has decided to abandon its pursuit to acquire <strong>International Paper
        Co.</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IP#NYSE\\\">IP</a>),&nbsp;one
        of&nbsp;North America&#8217;s&nbsp;largest recyclers and a global producer
        of packaging, pulp and other fiber-based products. This news triggered a nearly
        15% drop in International Paper&#8217;s shares during pre-market trading on
        Thursday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Suzano&#8217;s decision was prompted by International
        Paper&#8217;s rejection of its advances, Bloomberg <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-26/suzano-drops-its-pursuit-of-international-paper-acquisition\\\">reported</a>
        on Thursday. Instead, International Paper has chosen to focus on its own merger
        plans with a different competitor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At the time of writing,
        International Paper&#8217;s shares were trading at $39.67, a significant drop
        from Wednesday&#8217;s close of $46.61, according to <a href=\\\"https://pro.benzinga.com\\\">Benzinga

        had initially proposed a $15 billion acquisition offer to International Paper.
        However, the deal was based on the condition that International Paper abandon
        its plans to acquire British packaging firm <strong>DS Smith.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Suzano
        stated that it was unable to engage International Paper in serious discussions
        and was not willing to increase its offer. This announcement led Suzano&#8217;s
        U.S.-listed shares to see an 11.94% jump in the pre-market on Thursday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Suzano
        had hoped to negotiate on &#8220;private, confidential and amicable terms,&#8221;
        as per its statement. However, as this was not feasible, the company decided
        to terminate the talks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This development simplifies International
        Paper&#8217;s plan to acquire DS Smith Plc, a deal that is expected to close
        in the fourth quarter. If Suzano&#8217;s acquisition had been successful,
        the world&#8217;s largest pulp producer would have had the chance to expand
        internationally and diversify into the more stable packaging sector. However,
        there were investor concerns about Suzano&#8217;s ability to maintain its
        investment grade if it took on additional debt for the deal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Read

        <a href=\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/morgan-stanley-openai-powered-assistant-for-wealth-advisors.html\\\">reported</a>
        on Thursday. The program, built using <strong>Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI&#8217;s</strong>
        GPT-4, will be rolled out to the firm&#8217;s approximately 15,000 advisors
        by early July.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"What we're finding is that the quality

        to increased client engagement and business growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Debrief
        will initially be used in client meetings, with future versions allowing advisors
        to use the program on corporate devices during in-person meetings. Clients
        must consent to be recorded each time Debrief is used.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"As

        a significant surge in productivity</a> in AI-driven sectors, including professional
        and financial services. This growth was nearly five times faster than in other
        sectors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Moreover, OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT Enterprise has
        been gaining traction in the industry, with PwC becoming <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39058054/big-four-accounting-firm-becomes-openais-largest-chatgpt-enterprise-customer\\\">its
        largest customer</a> in May. A study by the University of Chicago also found
        that OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 had a relative advantage over humans in <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/05/39055523/openais-chatgpt-4-has-a-relative-advantage-over-humans-in-financial-analysis-study-finds-even-withou\\\">financial
        analysis and forecasting</a>, further underlining the potential of AI in the
